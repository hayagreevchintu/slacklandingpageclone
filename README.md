# Slack Landing Page Clone
This is an almost-clone of the slack landing page. I have added my touch to the design which is why this is an almost-clone of the existing slack landing page. This page is not yet responsive and I have built this completely using CSS. The buttons don't do anything yet but I'm thinking of adding backend functionality at a later point in time. I have added the screenshot of slack's default landing page that I have used as a reference to build the clone.

You can find the working version of this page at https://hayagreev-slack-landing-clone.herokuapp.com/
