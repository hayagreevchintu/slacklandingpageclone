# slacklandingpageclone
This is an almost-clone of the slack landing page. I have added my touch to the design which is why this is an almost-clone of the existing slack landing page. This page is not yet responsive and I have built this completely using CSS. The buttons don't do anything yet but I'm thinking of adding backend functionality at a later point in time. 

This code is open-source. Feel free to use this code for your reference but please give me credits coz, let's agree, leaching sucks.
